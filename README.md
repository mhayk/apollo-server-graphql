## Apollo Server + GraphQL + MongoDB
```
$ yarn add apollo-server graphql mongoose
$ yarn add nodemon sucrase -D
$ yarn add dotenv
```

**GraphQL** is a query language for API. It allows clients to only fetch the data they need, and makes it easy to map relationship between data types (hence "the graph").
